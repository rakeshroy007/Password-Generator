# Password-Generator
This is a simple and interactive Password Generator web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to generate different types of passwords, including funny, weak, strong, and super strong passwords. It also features a copy-to-clipboard functionality with a toast notification to inform the user when the password has been successfully copied.
